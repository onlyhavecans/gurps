# gurps

## Notes

This is a little tool I use for GMing remote gurps cames.
It's not super complete or powerful but I use it for secret rolls and checks quickly.
You can type random non commands or text after commands and it is ignored so you can leave notes when referrignback to past rolls

## Usage

just run it in command line and then type commands or random text to add notes
