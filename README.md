# gurps

## Notes

This is a little tool I use for GMing remote gurps cames.
It's not super powerful but I use it for secret rolls and checks.
You can type random text or add things after commands to annotate them.
Everything after a command, or text that is not a command is logged without error so you can leave notes.

The readline has basic history and writes out a history.txt.

## Usage

* download & run or use `cargo run --release` if you have rust installed
* Type commands to log info or roll
* h for help
* q for quit
